## How to Run

> List any commands to run your project. For example:

```sh
# Go to the terminal and locate to the directory,
path/to/your/directory

pipenv shell
pipenv install # will install all packages needed

Then run on your preferred IDE as a Jupyter Notebook. If you have VS Code, just click 'run all' on the top bar.
Jupyter notebooks saves output and console so you don't even need to run if you don't want to.
